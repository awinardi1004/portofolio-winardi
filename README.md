* Carry out the EDA process on the "Housing Price" dataset, using 1D and 2D visualization techniques.
* Splitting numerical and categorical data before entering the visualization stage


# [Classification Models : Game Prediction](https://github.com/awinardi1004/portofolio-winardi/blob/main/Game_Prediction.ipynb)
* This project aims to guess the result of a League of Legends match.
* The models used are logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and Gradient Bossing.
* The models used were evaluated and the results compared.
* It was found that the results showing Gradient Boosting, KNN, and Logistic Regression obtained the highest accuracy, namely 0.73.


# [Recommender System : Anime Recommender](https://github.com/awinardi1004/portofolio-winardi/blob/main/Anime_recomender_system.ipynb)
* This project aims to make recommendations for the most popular anime and guess how many ratings users will give to anime.

[Time Series : Sales Prediction](https://github.com/awinardi1004/portofolio-winardi/blob/main/Sales_time__Series.ipynb)
* This project predicts sales for the next month.
* The model used is SARIMAX.
* Based on the plot that has been made, it is known that there is a trend of increasing sales every month. We can also see the graph fluctuate periodically, which is a sign of seasonality.

[Deep Learning : Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/awinardi1004/portofolio-winardi/blob/main/Case_Study_04_Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb)
* This project aims to guess the stock price.
* The model used in this project is LTSM.
* The result obtained in this model is that the stock price tends to rise.
* the evaluation results obtained were very good with an RMSE value close to zero
